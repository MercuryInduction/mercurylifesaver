An intelligent IOT application based on car sensor data that provides instant relief and help during a crash or emergency. It introduces a new revolution that collaborates insurance companies, hospitals, first responders and the victim through webRTC video conferencing. The app also does analysis and social media sharing based on SMAC(Social Mobile Analytics Cloud) technology . In addition, it facilitates real time communication to minimize insurance fraud and maximize instant relief service which will foster human safety. Another add on feature is that the entire video conference is recorded and upload the video to cloud so that Insurance (claim adjuster) or any other organization can look at the entire incident of accident later on.
